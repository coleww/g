# g

Run CLI generator commands without paying attention to where you are or what you are really doing.

## Installation

Because somebody already has a gem named "g", you must:

    $ gem install geee

This will add `g` to yr path

## Usage

g accepts any and all arguments and/or options that ember generate or rails generate accept. For example, `g model foo` will just do the right thing depending on what kind of project you are currently in.
